# FETILDA
 Source code and Data Repository for FETILDA: Fin-tuned Embeddings of Texts In Long Document Analysis
 
# Python Scripts

The Python scripts used for running the experiments in the FETILDA paper are located in two main folders, "FIN10K-experiments-source-code" and "US-bank-experiments-source-code".

In order to replicate our experiments, run the Python scripts with the following command line arguments, like so:
```console
Python filename.py max-length section target-value total-#-of-epochs starting-epoch ending-epoch learning-rate
```
# Model Weights and Data

The saved weights of the best models for FETILDA on the FIN10K dataset are available here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5847105.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5847105).

The saved weights of the best frozen model for FETILDA on the US bank dataset are available here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5847335.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5847335).
